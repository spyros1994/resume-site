The user evaluates the aforementioned botcheries and potholes using an Android application. The application uses an accelerometer sensor to recognize the potholes . After the evaluation from the user, all the data are stored automatically to an online IoT platform(ThingSpeak). The user can use the android application to store on the same platform all the data that the arduino system has saved on the external storage. The communication between the smartphone and the android uno is via a OnTheGo cable."
